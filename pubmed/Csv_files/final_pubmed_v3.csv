2,immune checkpoint landscape of human atherosclerosis and influence of cardiometabolic factors.,"immune checkpoint inhibitor (ici) therapies can increase the risk of cardiovascular events in survivors of cancer by worsening atherosclerosis. here we map the expression of immune checkpoints (ics) within human carotid and coronary atherosclerotic plaques, revealing a network of immune cell interactions that ici treatments can unintentionally target in arteries. we identify a population of mature, regulatory ccr7<sup>+</sup>fscn1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells, similar to those described in tumors, as a hub of ic-mediated signaling within plaques. additionally, we show that type 2 diabetes and lipid-lowering therapies alter immune cell interactions through pd-1, ctla4, lag3 and other ic targets in clinical development, impacting plaque inflammation. this comprehensive map of the ic interactome in healthy and cardiometabolic disease states provides a framework for understanding the potential adverse and beneficial impacts of approved and investigational icis on atherosclerosis, setting the stage for designing ici strategies that minimize cardiovascular disease risk in cancer

3,ezrin drives adaptation of monocytes to the inflamed lung microenvironment.,"ezrin, an actin-binding protein, orchestrates the organization of the cortical cytoskeleton and plasma membrane during cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. its role in monocytes/macrophages (mφs) is less understood. here, we used a monocyte/mφ-specific ezrin knock-out mouse model to investigate the contribution of ezrin to monocyte recruitment and adaptation to the lung extracellular matrix (ecm) in response to lipopolysaccharide (lps). our study revealed that lps induces ezrin expression in monocytes/mφs and is essential for monocytes to adhere to lung ecm, proliferate, and differentiate into tissue-resident interstitial mφs. mechanistically, the loss of ezrin in monocytes disrupts activation of focal adhesion kinase and akt serine-threonine protein kinase signaling, essential for lung-recruited monocytes and monocyte-derived mφs to adhere to the ecm, proliferate, and survive. in summary, our data show that ezrin plays a role beyond structural cellular support, influencing diverse monocytes/mφ processes and signaling pathways during inflammation, facilitating their differentiation into tissue-resident macrophages.",cell death & disease,eng,2024,Nov,"Gudneppanavar Ravindra, Di Pietro Caterina, H Öz Hasan, Zhang Ping-Xia, Cheng Ee-Chun, Huang Pamela H, Tebaldi Toma, Biancon Giulia, Halene Stephanie, Hoppe Adam D, Kim Catherine, Gonzalez Anjelica L, Krause Diane S, Egan Marie E, Gupta Neetu, Murray Thomas S, Bruscia Emanuela M","department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of chemistry and biochemistry, south dakota state university, brookings, sd, usa., department of biomedical engineering, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of biomedical engineering, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of inflammation and immunity, cleveland clinic foundation, cleveland, oh, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa., department of pediatrics, school of medicine, yale university, new haven, ct, usa. emanuela.bruscia@yale.edu.",cell death & disease,cell death dis,2041-4889,2041-4889,8.1,8.6,CELL BIOLOGY|Q1|33/205,"school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, south dakota state university, yale university, yale university, yale stem cell center, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university, cleveland clinic foundation, school of medicine, yale university, school of medicine, yale university",Unknown,yale university,10,94.9,10.0,High (75-100)

27,metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a review and position statement of the fatty liver research group of the korean diabetes association.,"since the role of the liver in metabolic dysfunction, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, was demonstrated, studies on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (mafld) have shown associations between fatty liver disease and other metabolic diseases. unlike the exclusionary diagnostic criteria of nafld, mafld diagnosis is based on the presence of metabolic dysregulation in fatty liver disease. renaming nafld as mafld also introduced simpler diagnostic criteria. in 2023, a new nomenclature, steatotic liver disease (sld), was proposed. similar to mafld, sld diagnosis is based on the presence of hepatic steatosis with at least one cardiometabolic dysfunction. sld is categorized into metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (masld), metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-related/-associated liver disease, alcoholrelated liver disease, specific etiology sld, and cryptogenic sld. the term masld has been adopted by a number of leading national and international societies due to its concise diagnostic criteria, exclusion of other concomitant liver diseases, and lack of stigmatizing terms. this article reviews the diagnostic criteria, clinical relevance, and differences among nafld, mafld, and masld from a diabetologist's perspective and provides a rationale for adopting sld/masld in the fatty liver research

[h<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> falls toward the vitreous as well, but less, so that the inner retina is acidic to the vitreous. light leads to complex changes with both electrogenic and metabolic origins, culminating in alkalinization. there is a rhythm of [h<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> with h<sup>+</sup> being higher during circadian night. extracellular ph can potentially be used as a signal in intercellular volume transmission, but evidence is against ph as a normal controller of fluid transport across the rpe or as a horizontal cell feedback signal. pathological and experimentally created conditions (systemic metabolic acidosis, hypoxia and ischemia, vascular occlusion, excess glucose and diabetes, genetic disorders, and blockade of carbonic anhydrase) disturb h<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, mostly producing retinal acidosis, with consequences for retinal blood flow, metabolism and function.",progress in retinal and eye research,eng,2024,Nov,"Dmitriev Andrey V, Linsenmeier Robert A","department of biomedical engineering, northwestern university, evanston, il. electronic address: anvadmi@gmail.com., department of biomedical engineering, northwestern university, evanston, il; department of neurobiology, northwestern university, evanston, il; department of ophthalmology, northwestern university, chicago, il. electronic address: r-linsenmeier@northwestern.edu.",progress in retinal and eye research,prog retin eye res,1350-9462,1873-1635,18.6,20.3,OPHTHALMOLOGY|Q1|1/95,"northwestern university, department of biomedical engineering, northwestern university, northwestern university, northwestern university",Unknown,northwestern university,28,78.8,28.0,High (75-100)

48,why exercise may never be effective medicine: an evolutionary perspective on the efficacy versus effectiveness of exercise in treating type 2 diabetes.,"most cases of type 2 diabetes (t2d) can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle, highlighting that lifestyle modifications should be the primary defence against developing t2d. although accumulating evidence suggests that exercise can be an efficacious therapy for t2d, especially in conjunction with pharmacological interventions, its long-term effectiveness remains controversial owing to significant adherence challenges. in this narrative review, we combine an evolutionary perspective with epidemiological and prospective interventional studies to examine the efficacy versus effectiveness of varying volumes of exercise prescriptions for treating t2d. commonly prescribed and recommended volumes of moderate-intensity physical activity (150 min/week) have demonstrated low-to-moderate efficacy in improving glycaemic control, reflected by improvements in glycated haemoglobin levels. higher exercise volumes have been shown to enhance efficacy. while exercise can be moderately efficacious under the optimal circumstances of short-term exercise interventions (≤1 year), there is little evidence of its long-term effectiveness, primarily due to poor adherence. to date, no study has demonstrated long-term adherence to exercise programmes in individuals with t2d (>1 year). from an evolutionary perspective, the finding that exercise interventions are often ineffective over time is unsurprising. although often overlooked, humans never evolved to exercise. exercise is a counter-instinctive behaviour that can be difficult to maintain, even in healthy populations and can be especially challenging for individuals who are unfit or have t2d morbidities. we conclude by presenting several considerations informed by evolutionary logic that may be useful for practitioners, policymakers and advocates of exercise as medicine to improve exercise adherence.",british journal of sports medicine,eng,2024,Nov,"MacDonald Christopher, Bennekou Mia, Midtgaard Julie, Langberg Hennig, Lieberman Daniel","centre of inflammation and metabolism and the centre for physical activity research, university of copenhagen, kobenhavn, denmark., grace health and performance enhancement, copenhagen, denmark., department of public health, university of copenhagen, kobenhavn, denmark., department of public health, university of copenhagen, kobenhavn, denmark., human evolutionary biology, harvard university, cambridge, massachusetts, usa danlieb@fas.harvard.edu.",british journal of sports medicine,brit j sport med,0306-3674,1473-0480,11.6,14.4,SPORT SCIENCES|Q1|1/127,"university of copenhagen, department of public health, university of copenhagen, department of public health, university of copenhagen, harvard university",prospective interventional studies,harvard university,4,99.9,4.0,High (75-100)

59,a wearable osmotic microneedle patch provides high-capacity sustained drug delivery in animal models.,"the maintenance of stable plasma drug concentrations within a therapeutic window can be critical for drug efficacy. here, we developed a wearable osmotic microneedle (omn) patch to support sustained drug dosing for at least 24 hours without the use of electronic components. the omn patch uses an osmotic pressure driving force to deliver drug solution into the skin through three hollow microneedles with diameters of less than 200 micrometers. the rate of drug release was related to the composition and concentration of the osmogen and drug and to the physical properties of the semipermeable membrane separating the low- and high-solute compartments. the omn patch released the peptide drug exenatide in rats and mice for 24 hours, whereas subcutaneous injection resulted in a burst release and rapid decline in the plasma drug concentration. omn release of exenatide improved glycemic control in a diabetic mouse model consistent with a sustained effective plasma concentration of the drug. continuous release of the small-molecule chemotherapeutic drug cytarabine reduced the progression of acute myeloid leukemia in mice more effectively than subcutaneous injection. further evaluation of the omn patch in canines demonstrated continuous dosing of cytarabine up to 225 milligrams for 24 hours, satisfying clinical requirements (150 to 300 milligrams daily). omn patches were well tolerated in human participants with minimal pain or irritation of the skin and a stated

65,insulin-degrading enzyme regulates insulin-directed cellular autoimmunity in murine type 1 diabetes.,"type 1 diabetes results from the destruction of pancreatic beta cells by autoreactive t cells. as an autoantigen with extremely high expression in beta cells, insulin triggers and sustains the autoimmune cd4<sup>+</sup> and cd8<sup>+</sup> t cell responses and islet inflammation. we have previously shown that deficiency for insulin-degrading enzyme (ide), a ubiquitous cytosolic protease with very high affinity for insulin, induces endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress and proliferation in islet cells and protects non-obese diabetic mice (nod) from diabetes. here we wondered whether ide deficiency affects autoreactive cd8<sup>+</sup> t cell responses to insulin and thereby immune pathogenesis in nod mice. we find that <i>ide<sup>-/-</sup></i> nod harbor fewer diabetogenic t cells and reduced numbers of cd8<sup>+</sup> t cells recognizing the dominant autoantigen insulin and islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (igrp). using <i>in vitro</i> digestions and cellular antigen presentation assays, we show that generation of the dominant insulin epitope b<sub>15-23</sub> involves both the proteasome and ide. ide deficiency attenuates mhc-i presentation of the immunodominant insulin epitope by beta cells to cognate cd8<sup>+</sup> t cells. consequently, <i>ide<sup>-/-</sup></i> islets display reduced susceptibility to autoimmune destruction upon grafting, and to killing by insulin-specific cd8<sup>+</sup> t cells. moreover, <i>ide<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice are partly resistant to disease transfer by cd8<sup>+</sup> t cells specific for insulin but not for igrp. thus, ide has a dual role in beta cells, regulating er stress and proliferation while at the same time promoting insulin-directed autoreactive cd8<sup>+</sup> t cell responses.",frontiers in immunology,eng,2024,No Data,"Bessard Marie-Andrée, Moser Anna, Waeckel-Énée Emmanuelle, Lindo Vivian, Gdoura Abdelaziz, You Sylvaine, Wong F Susan, Greer Fiona, van Endert Peter","université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut necker enfants malades, paris, france., université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut necker enfants malades, paris, france., université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut necker enfants malades, paris, france., m-scan, wokingham, united kingdom., université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut necker enfants malades, paris, france., université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut cochin, paris, france., institute of molecular and experimental medicine, school of medicine, cardiff university, cardiff, united kingdom., m-scan, wokingham, united kingdom., université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), institut necker enfants malades, paris, france.",frontiers in immunology,front immunol,1664-3224,1664-3224,5.7,6.8,IMMUNOLOGY|Q1|38/181,"université paris cité, institut national de la santé et recherche médicale (inserm), université paris cité, centre national de la recherche scientifique (cnrs), université paris cité, université paris cité, université paris cité, institute of molecular and experimental medicine, cardiff university, université paris cité",cellular antigen presentation assays,cardiff university,190,39.6,190.0,Low (0-50)

82,targeting glucose metabolism: a novel therapeutic approach for parkinson's disease.,"glucose metabolism is essential for the maintenance and function of the central nervous system. although the brain constitutes only 2% of the body weight, it consumes approximately 20% of the body's total energy, predominantly derived from glucose. this high energy demand of the brain underscores its reliance on glucose to fuel various functions, including neuronal activity, synaptic transmission, and the maintenance of ion gradients necessary for nerve impulse transmission. increasing evidence shows that many neurodegenerative diseases, including parkinson's disease (pd), are associated with abnormalities in glucose metabolism. pd is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, accompanied by the accumulation of α-synuclein protein aggregates. these pathological features are exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, all of which are influenced by glucose metabolism disruptions. emerging evidence suggests that targeting glucose metabolism could offer therapeutic benefits for pd. several antidiabetic drugs have shown promise in animal models and clinical trials for mitigating the symptoms and progression of pd. this review explores the current understanding of the association between pd and glucose metabolism, emphasizing the potential of antidiabetic medications as a novel therapeutic approach. by improving glucose uptake and utilization, enhancing mitochondrial function, and reducing neuroinflammation, these drugs could address key pathophysiological mechanisms in pd, offering hope for more effective management of this debilitating disease.",cells,eng,2024,Nov,"Tanvir Ahmed, Jo Junghyun, Park Sang Myun","department of pharmacology, ajou university school of medicine, suwon 16499, republic of korea., department of pharmacology, ajou university school of medicine, suwon 16499, republic of korea., department of pharmacology, ajou university school of medicine, suwon 16499, republic of korea.",cells,cells-basel,,2073-4409,5.1,6.0,CELL BIOLOGY|Q2|63/205,"ajou university school of medicine, republic of korea, ajou university school of medicine, republic of korea, ajou university school of medicine, republic of korea",animal models,ajou university,501–600,37.7,550.5,Low (0-50)
83,does incretin agonism have sustainable efficacy?,"recent clinical trials using synthetic incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) receptor agonists have demonstrated that these treatments ameliorated many complications related to obesity, emphasizing the significant impact of body weight on overall health. incretins are enteroendocrine hormones secreted by gut endothelial cells triggered by nutrient ingestion. the phenomenon that oral ingestion of glucose elicits a much higher insulin secretion than intra-venous injection of equimolar glucose is known as the incretin effect. this also alludes to the thesis that food intake is the root cause of insulin resistance. synthetic glp-1 and gip agonists have demonstrated unprecedented glucoregulation and body weight reduction. also, randomized trials have shown their ability to prevent complications of obesity, including development of diabetes from prediabetes, reducing cardiovascular disease risks and renal complications in diabetic patients. moreover, the benefits of these agonists persist among the patients who are already on metformin or insulin. the ultimate question is ""are these benefits of incretin agonism sustainable?"" chronic agonism of pancreatic β-cells may decrease the number of receptors and cause β-cell exhaustion, leading to β-cell failure. unfortunately, the long-term effects of these drugs are unknown at the present because the longest duration in randomized trials is 3 years. additionally, manipulation of the neurohormonal axis to control satiety and food intake may hinder the long-term sustainability of these treatments. in this review, we will discuss the incretins' mechanism of action, challenges, and future directions. we will briefly review other molecules involved in glucose homeostasis such as amylin and glucagon. amylin is co-expressed with insulin from the pancreas β-cells but does not have insulinotropic function. amylin suppresses glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying and suppressing the reward center in the central nervous system, leading to weight loss. however, amylin can self-aggregate and cause serious cytotoxicity and may cause β-cell apoptosis. glucagon is secreted by pancreatic α-cells and participates in glucose homeostasis in a glucose-dependent manner. in hypoglycemia, glucagon increases the blood glucose level by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycogenesis in the liver. several triple agonists, in combination with dual incretins and glucagon, are being developed.",cells,eng,2024,Nov,"Janket Sok-Ja, Chatanaka Miyo K, Sohaei Dorsa, Tamimi Faleh, Meurman Jukka H, Diamandis Eleftherios P","retired research associate professor, boston university goldman school of dental medicine, boston, ma 02118, usa., department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology, university of toronto, toronto, on m5s 1a8, canada., m.d., c.m. candidate 2026, faculty of medicine and health sciences, mcgill university, montreal, qc h4a qt2, canada., department of restorative dentistry, college of dental medicine, qatar university, doha p.o. box 2713, qatar., department of oral and maxillofacial diseases, helsinki university hospital and university of helsinki, fi-00290 helsinki, finland., lunenfeld-tanenbaum research institute, sinai health system, toronto, on m5t 3l9, canada.",cells,cells-basel,,2073-4409,5.1,6.0,CELL BIOLOGY|Q2|63/205,"boston university, goldman school of dental medicine, university of toronto, mcgill university, college of dental medicine, qatar university, helsinki university hospital, university of helsinki, lunenfeld-tanenbaum research institute, sinai health system",clinical trials,boston university,78,54.1,78.0,Medium (50-75)

183,does incretin agonism have sustainable efficacy?,"recent clinical trials using synthetic incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (glp-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) receptor agonists have demonstrated that these treatments ameliorated many complications related to obesity, emphasizing the significant impact of body weight on overall health. incretins are enteroendocrine hormones secreted by gut endothelial cells triggered by nutrient ingestion. the phenomenon that oral ingestion of glucose elicits a much higher insulin secretion than intra-venous injection of equimolar glucose is known as the incretin effect. this also alludes to the thesis that food intake is the root cause of insulin resistance. synthetic glp-1 and gip agonists have demonstrated unprecedented glucoregulation and body weight reduction. also, randomized trials have shown their ability to prevent complications of obesity, including development of diabetes from prediabetes, reducing cardiovascular disease risks and renal complications in diabetic patients. moreover, the benefits of these agonists persist among the patients who are already on metformin or insulin. the ultimate question is ""are these benefits of incretin agonism sustainable?"" chronic agonism of pancreatic β-cells may decrease the number of receptors and cause β-cell exhaustion, leading to β-cell failure. unfortunately, the long-term effects of these drugs are unknown at the present because the longest duration in randomized trials is 3 years. additionally, manipulation of the neurohormonal axis to control satiety and food intake may hinder the long-term sustainability of these treatments. in this review, we will discuss the incretins' mechanism of action, challenges, and future directions. we will briefly review other molecules involved in glucose homeostasis such as amylin and glucagon. amylin is co-expressed with insulin from the pancreas β-cells but does not have insulinotropic function. amylin suppresses glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying and suppressing the reward center in the central nervous system, leading to weight loss. however, amylin can self-aggregate and cause serious cytotoxicity and may cause β-cell apoptosis. glucagon is secreted by pancreatic α-cells and participates in glucose homeostasis in a glucose-dependent manner. in hypoglycemia, glucagon increases the blood glucose level by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and inhibits glycogenesis in the liver. several triple agonists, in combination with dual incretins and glucagon, are being developed.",cells,eng,2024,Nov,"Janket Sok-Ja, Chatanaka Miyo K, Sohaei Dorsa, Tamimi Faleh, Meurman Jukka H, Diamandis Eleftherios P","retired research associate professor, boston university goldman school of dental medicine, boston, ma 02118, usa., department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology, university of toronto, toronto, on m5s 1a8, canada., m.d., c.m. candidate 2026, faculty of medicine and health sciences, mcgill university, montreal, qc h4a qt2, canada., department of restorative dentistry, college of dental medicine, qatar university, doha p.o. box 2713, qatar., department of oral and maxillofacial diseases, helsinki university hospital and university of helsinki, fi-00290 helsinki, finland., lunenfeld-tanenbaum research institute, sinai health system, toronto, on m5t 3l9, canada.",cells,cells-basel,,2073-4409,5.1,6.0,CELL BIOLOGY|Q2|63/205,"boston university, goldman school of dental medicine, university of toronto, mcgill university, college of dental medicine, qatar university, helsinki university hospital, university of helsinki, lunenfeld-tanenbaum research institute, sinai health system",clinical trials,boston university,78,54.1,78.0,Medium (50-75)

(2) currently, the atm, atr, cgas/sting, and noncanonical pathways are the main pathways that involve in the regulatory network of r-loops in cancer. (3) cancer biology can be modulated by r-loops-regulated phenotypes, including rna methylation, dna and histone methylation, oxidative stress, immune and inflammation regulation, and senescence. (4) regulation of r-loops induces kinds of drug resistance in various cancers, suggesting that targeting r-loops maybe a promising way to overcome treatment resistance. (5) the role of r-loops in tumorigenesis remains controversial, and senescence may be a crucial research direction to unravel the mechanism of r-loop-induced tumorigenesis. looking forward, further studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms of r-loops in cancer, laying the groundwork for preclinical and clinical research.",cancer letters,eng,2024,Nov,"Li Dengxiong, Shao Fanglin, Li Xinrui, Yu Qingxin, Wu Ruicheng, Wang Jie, Wang Zhipeng, Wusiman Dilinaer, Ye Luxia, Guo Yiqing, Tuo Zhouting, Wei Wuran, Yoo Koo Han, Cho William C, Feng Dechao","department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, chengdu 610041, china., department of rehabilitation, the affiliated hospital of southwest medical university, luzhou 646000, p.r. china., department of rehabilitation, the affiliated hospital of southwest medical university, luzhou 646000, p.r. china., department of pathology, ningbo clinical pathology diagnosis center, ningbo city, zhejiang province, 315211, china., department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, chengdu 610041, china., department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, chengdu 610041, china., department of urology, sichuan provincial people's hospital, university of electronic science and technology of china, chengdu, china., department of comparative pathobiology, college of veterinary medicine; purdue institute for cancer research, purdue university, west lafayette, in, usa., department of public research platform, taizhou hospital of zhejiang province affiliated to wenzhou medical university, linhai, china., department of public research platform, taizhou hospital of zhejiang province affiliated to wenzhou medical university, linhai, china., department of urological surgery, daping hospital, army medical center of pla, army medical university, chongqing, china., department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, chengdu 610041, china., department of urology, kyung hee university, south korea., department of clinical oncology, queen elizabeth hospital, hong kong sar china. electronic address: williamcscho@gmail.com., division of surgery & interventional science, university college london, london w1w 7ts, uk. electronic address: dechao.feng@ucl.ac.uk.",cancer letters,cancer lett,0304-3835,1872-7980,9.1,8.3,ONCOLOGY|Q1|33/322,"department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, department of rehabilitation, southwest medical university, department of rehabilitation, southwest medical university, department of urology, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, sichuan provincial people's hospital, university of electronic science and technology of china, college of veterinary medicine, purdue institute for cancer research, purdue university, department of public research platform, taizhou hospital of zhejiang province, wenzhou medical university, department of public research platform, taizhou hospital of zhejiang province, wenzhou medical university, daping hospital, army medical center of pla, army medical university, institute of urology, west china hospital, sichuan university, kyung hee university, queen elizabeth hospital, university college london",preclinical and clinical research,sichuan university,150,57.3,150.0,Medium (50-75)

and using them for training about how to manage intraoperative bleeding during endoscopic submucosal dissection (esd) is unsatisfactory. this study aimed to identify the appropriate heparin dose in an intraoperative bleeding model and validate its applicability. <b>methods:</b> first, we explored the dose of heparin required for a swine bleeding model in which the activated clotting time reached and maintained the upper limit of measurement (1500 s) after 10 minutes. second, we compared intraoperative bleeding and hematoma frequency during esd for 2-cm lesions between the heparinized bleeding model and control groups. intraoperative bleeding was classified according to the forrest classification. <b>results:</b> the combination of a bolus (300 u/kg), continuous infusion (300 u/kg/h), and a bolus dose (150 u/kg) of heparin 10 minutes after the first infusion was identified as the dose for the bleeding model. five esds were performed in each heparinized bleeding model and the control group. the median number of intraoperative bleeds was significantly higher in the heparinized model than in the control group (5 interquartile range [iqr] 4-7 vs. 3 [iqr 0-4, <i>p</i> = 0.028). all of the intraoperative bleeding events oozing (forrest ib) rather than spurting (forrest ia). the median number of hematomas was significantly higher in the heparinized model group than in the control

278,design and evaluation of pyridinyl sulfonyl piperazine lpxh inhibitors with potent antibiotic activity against enterobacterales.,"enterobacterales, a large order of gram-negative bacteria, including <i>escherichia coli</i> and <i>klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, are major causes of urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections, pneumonia, and other diseases in healthcare settings and communities. esbl-producing enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales can break down commonly used antibiotics, with some strains being resistant to all available antibiotics. this public health threat necessitates the development of novel antibiotics, ideally targeting new pathways in these bacteria. gram-negative bacteria possess an outer membrane enriched with lipid a, a saccharolipid that serves as the membrane anchor of lipopolysaccharides and the active component of the bacterial endotoxin, causing septic shock. the biosynthesis of lipid a is crucial for the viability of gram-negative bacteria, and as an essential enzyme in this process, lpxh has emerged as a promising target for developing novel antibiotics against multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. here, we report the development of pyridinyl sulfonyl piperazine lpxh inhibitors. among them, <i>ortho</i>-substituted pyridinyl compounds significantly boost lpxh inhibition and antibiotic activity over the original phenyl series. structural and qm/mm analyses reveal that these improved activities are primarily due to the enhanced interaction between f141 of the lpxh insertion lid and the pyridinyl group. incorporation of the <i>n</i>-methyl-<i>n</i>-phenyl-methanesulfonamide moiety into the pyridinyl sulfonyl piperazine backbone results in jh-lph-106 and jh-lph-107, both of which exhibit potent antibiotic activity against wild-type enterobacterales such as <i>k. pneumoniae</i> and <i>e. coli</i>. jh-lph-107 exhibits a low rate of spontaneous resistance and a high safety window <i>in vitro</i>, rendering it an excellent lead for further clinical development.",jacs au,eng,2024,Nov,"Ennis Amanda F, Cochrane C Skyler, Dome Patrick A, Jeong Pyeonghwa, Yu Jincheng, Lee Hyejin, Williams Carly S, Ha Yang, Yang Weitao, Zhou Pei, Hong Jiyong","department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of biochemistry, duke university school of medicine, durham, north carolina 27710, united states., berkeley center for structural biology, molecular biophysics and integrated bioimaging, lawrence berkeley national laboratory, berkeley, california 94720, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states., department of chemistry, duke university, durham, north carolina 27708, united states.",jacs au,jacs au,,2691-3704,8.5,8.5,"CHEMISTRY, MULTIDISCIPLINARY|Q1|35/230","duke university, duke university, duke university, duke university, duke university, duke university, duke university, lawrence berkeley national laboratory, duke university, duke university, duke university",Unknown,duke university,26,76.1,26.0,High (75-100)

286,from nature's pharmacy: harnessing bioactive phytoconstituents as fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 inhibitors for anti-cancer therapeutics.,"fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (fgfr3) is a key protein involved in regulating cell growth and development. aberrant activation of fgfr3 has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and skeletal disorders. therefore, identifying potential inhibitors of fgfr3 is of great interest in developing targeted therapies. in this study, we employed a combined docking and molecular dynamics simulation (mds) approach to investigate the inhibitory potential of plant-based compounds against fgfr3. here, we utilized structure-based virtual screening to identify potential phytoconstituents from the imppat library with the ability to inhibit fgfr3 activity. the initial screening process involved molecular docking to assess the binding potential of the compounds towards fgfr3. afterward, we employed various filters to determine physicochemical properties, admet, and pass evaluation to identify potential hits against fgfr3. this process discovered two phytoconstituents, cycloartobiloxanthone and desoxylimonin, as promising candidates against fgfr3. these compounds exhibited favorable binding affinity, efficiency, and specific interaction towards the fgfr3 binding pocket. they preferred binding to the active site of fgfr3 and possessed desirable drug-like properties. to gain a deeper understanding of their interaction mechanism, conformational dynamics, and stability, we conducted all-atom mds lasting 200 nanoseconds (ns) on the fgfr3-cycloartobiloxanthone and fgfr3-desoxylimonin complexes. the mds consistently demonstrated the formation of stable protein-ligand complexes between fgfr3 and cycloartobiloxanthone/desoxylimonin throughout the trajectory. based on these results, it can be inferred that cycloartobiloxanthone and desoxylimonin can potentially serve as valuable scaffolds in developing drugs targeting fgfr3 for cancer therapeutic after required validation.",journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,eng,2024,Nov,"Alsaiari Ahad Amer, Almehmadi Mazen, Gharib Amal F, Alrehaili Amani A, Ali Alsaeedi Fouzeyyah, Bakhuraysah Maha M, Algethami Shatha M, Hawsawi Nahed M, Hakami Mohammed Ageeli","department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, taif, saudi arabia., department of clinical laboratory sciences, college of applied medical sciences, shaqra university, al-quwayiyah, riyadh, saudi arabia.",journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,j biomol struct dyn,0739-1102,1538-0254,2.7,3.2,BIOPHYSICS|Q2|35/77,"college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, taif university, college of applied medical sciences, shaqra university",Unknown,taif university,501–600,17.8,550.5,Low (0-50)

298,cmtm7 shapes the chronic inflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma as an m2 macrophage biomarker.,"transmembrane domain-containing 7 (cmtm7) is a protein located at the plasma membrane. it plays a role in regulating the development and immune microenvironment of tumor cells. however, the impact of cmtm7 on hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) is not well understood. to better understand the role of cmtm7 in hcc, the correlations of cmtm7 with clinical characteristics, patient prognosis, chronic inflammation, and immune cell infiltration were analyzed using tissue microarray slides, sequencing datasets and various analysis tools (web). the bulk sequencing analysis indicated that elevated expression of cmtm7 appears to promote chronic inflammation, immunosuppression, m2 macrophage infiltration, a diminished response to cancer immunotherapy, and an unfavorable clinical prognosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). further investigation through single-cell rna sequencing and multiple fluorescence staining demonstrated that cmtm7 serves as a molecular marker for m2 macrophages and is associated with t cell exhaustion as well as highly plastic stem-like characteristics. we propose that cmtm7 may represent a novel immune checkpoint for hcc patients experiencing suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. utilizing the connectivity map and autodock vina, we predicted two potential compounds targeting cmtm7-fasudil and arachidonyltrifluoromethane-as promising therapeutic candidates. collectively, these findings suggest that cmtm7-positive macrophages play significant roles in establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment while promoting highly plastic and stem-like traits in hcc cells, ultimately contributing to poor prognostic outcomes.",scientific reports,eng,2024,Nov,"Zhu Zhipeng, Liu Hanzhi, Fu Huafeng, Luo Yu, Chen Baisheng, Wu Xiaofang, Sun Anran, Zhang Fuxing, Wang Tao","institute of medical innovation and research, peking university third hospital, beijing, 100191, china., the third clinical medical college, gannan medical university, ganzhou, 341000, jiangxi, china., center for gastrointestinal surgery, the first affiliated hospital of sun yat-sen university, guangzhou, 510030, guangdong, china., the key laboratory of urinary tract tumors and calculi, department of urology surgery, the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university, school of medicine, xiamen university, xiamen, 361003, fujian, china., endoscopy center, zhongshan hospital of fudan university (xiamen branch), xiamen, 361001, fujian, china., department of general surgery, the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university, school of medicine, xiamen university, xiamen, 361103, fujian, china., oncology research center, foresea life insurance guangzhou general hospital, guangzhou, 511300, guangdong, china. sunanran@aliyun.com., department of general surgery, the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university, school of medicine, xiamen university, xiamen, 361103, fujian, china. zhangfuxing@medmail.com.cn., the key laboratory of urinary tract tumors and calculi, department of urology surgery, the first affiliated hospital of xiamen university, school of medicine, xiamen university, xiamen, 361003, fujian, china. taowang@xmu.edu.cn.",scientific reports,sci rep-uk,2045-2322,2045-2322,3.8,4.3,MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES|Q1|25/134,"peking university third hospital, gannan medical university, sun yat-sen university, xiamen university, xiamen university, fudan university, xiamen university, xiamen university, guangzhou general hospital, xiamen university, xiamen university, xiamen university, xiamen university",Unknown,peking university,14,97.3,14.0,High (75-100)

313,assessing and improving women representation in radiology leadership positions.,"gender representation remains a critical issue in professions, especially within medical specialties like radiology, where the representation of women in leadership roles significantly lags. despite a promising increase in women physicians in canada, reaching 42.7% by 2019, radiology showcases a stark gender disparity, particularly in leadership positions. this article examines the barriers hindering women's advancement in radiology and proposes actionable solutions to cultivate a more equitable environment. it highlights the underrepresentation of women in radiology leadership across the united states and canada, with women holding significantly fewer senior academic positions and leadership roles. key barriers include a lack of women role models, gender-based obstacles in research opportunities, and by design discriminatory practices. solutions proposed include the establishment of mentorship programs, and inclusive policies at multiple organizational levels such as at the level of trainees, faculty and leadership positions including chair of the department. additionally, policies and initiatives centred on education and training in unconscious bias, the creation of professional groups for women in radiology, and interventions to address unsafe work environments.",current problems in diagnostic radiology,eng,2025,No Data,"Sharma Sonali, Malik Aleena, Matschek Jessica, Zaki-Metias Kaitlin M, Gandhi Rushali, Yong-Hing Charlotte J, Khosa Faisal","department of radiology, faculty of medicine, university of british columbia, vancouver, british columbia, canada. electronic address: sonali@alumni.ubc.ca., temerty faculty of medicine, university of toronto, toronto, on, canada., faculty of medicine, mcgill university, montreal, qc, canada., department of medical imaging, western university, london, on, canada., faculty of medicine, mcgill university, montreal, qc, canada., department of radiology, faculty of medicine, university of british columbia, vancouver, british columbia, canada; diagnostic imaging, bc cancer vancouver, british columbia, canada. electronic address: charlotte.yonghing@bccancer.bc.ca., vancouver general hospital, jim pattison pavilion, 899 w 12th ave, vancouver, bc v5z 1m9, canada. electronic address: fkhosa@gmail.com.",current problems in diagnostic radiology,curr probl diagn rad,0363-0188,0363-0188,1.5,1.4,"RADIOLOGY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE & MEDICAL IMAGING|Q3|124/204","university of british columbia, university of toronto, mcgill university, western university, mcgill university, university of british columbia, vancouver general hospital",Unknown,mcgill university,49,72.3,49.0,Medium (50-75)
314,gender dynamics in radiology: the influence of terminology on subspecialty choices.,"gender disparity in radiology and its subspecialties presents a significant and persistent challenge, with only a small fraction of female canadian medical students choosing radiology compared to their male counterparts. this disparity is further reflected in the professional landscape, where only 23% of practicing radiologists are women, predominantly concentrated in ""women's imaging,"" which typically includes breast and gynecological imaging. this categorization not only perpetuates professional segregation by reinforcing gender stereotypes but also impacts patient care and research by suggesting that these areas are exclusively women's health issues. this paper explores the consequences of the ""women's imaging"" label and advocates for a reevaluation and renaming of subspecialties to more neutral, organspecific terms to encourage broader interest and participation. furthermore, we propose strategies to enhance gender equity across all radiological subspecialties, including integrating radiology more thoroughly into medical education and promoting visible leadership roles for women.",current problems in diagnostic radiology,eng,2025,No Data,"Sharma Sonali, Zaki-Metias Kaitlin M, Matschek Jessica, Malik Aleena, Stevenson Amanda, Yong-Hing Charlotte J","department of radiology, faculty of medicine, university of british columbia, vancouver, british columbia, canada. electronic address: sonali@alumni.ubc.ca., department of medical imaging, western university, london, on, canada., faculty of medicine, mcgill university, montreal, qc, canada., temerty faculty of medicine, university of toronto, toronto, on, canada., faculty of medicine, mcgill university, montreal, qc, canada., department of radiology, faculty of medicine, university of british columbia, vancouver, british columbia, canada; diagnostic imaging, bc cancer vancouver, british columbia, canada.",current problems in diagnostic radiology,curr probl diagn rad,0363-0188,0363-0188,1.5,1.4,"RADIOLOGY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE & MEDICAL IMAGING|Q3|124/204","university of british columbia, western university, faculty of medicine, mcgill university, university of toronto, mcgill university, university of british columbia",research,western university,201–250,42.9,225.5,Low (0-50)

330,immunogenic clearance combined with pd-1 blockade elicits antitumor effect by promoting the recruitment and expansion of the effector memory-like cd8<sup>+</sup>t cell.,"immune checkpoint inhibition shows promise for cancer treatment, but only a minority of patients respond. combination strategies have been explored to overcome this resistance. combining immunogenic clearance using immunogenic cell death inducers with a rho kinase inhibitor enhances phagocytosis of immunogenically dying cancer cells by antigen-presenting cells, stimulating tumor-specific immune responses by activating cd8<sup>+</sup>t cells via dendritic cell-mediated priming. this approach increases the responsiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (icb)-resistant cancer to icb. however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. this study elucidates cellular mechanisms of immunogenic clearance enhancing icb response. using single-cell rna sequencing, we observed an increase in effector memory-like cd8<sup>+</sup>t cells within the tumor microenvironment with combined treatment. we propose this cell cluster may originate from proliferating cd8<sup>+</sup>t cells elevated by immunogenic clearance. notably, abundant effector memory-like cd8<sup>+</sup>t cells in icb-responsive patients suggest their antitumor effect. thus, increasing this cell population through enhanced t cell priming may improve the response of icb-resistant tumors.",translational oncology,eng,2024,Nov,"Kim Seong A, Kim Seohyun, Hong Yeonsun, Choi Yoonjeong, Lee Yeji, Kwon Minsu, Park Seung-Yoon, Jeong Cherlhyun, Nam Gi-Hoon, Han Rafael T, Kim In-San","ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea., ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; department of research and development, shiftbio, seoul 02751, republic of korea., ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea., ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; department of research and development, shiftbio, seoul 02751, republic of korea., ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea., department of otolaryngology, asan medical center, university of ulsan college of medicine, seoul 05505, republic of korea., department of biochemistry, school of medicine, dongguk university, gyeongju 38066, republic of korea., biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea; department of biological chemistry, korea university of science and technology, kist campus, 02841, republic of korea., department of research and development, shiftbio, seoul 02751, republic of korea; department of biochemistry and molecular biology, korea university college of medicine, seoul 02841, republic of korea. electronic address: maxcrates@korea.ac.kr., biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea; khu-kist department of converging science and technology, kyung hee university, seoul 02447, republic of korea. electronic address: rt.han@kist.re.kr., ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, seoul 02841, republic of korea; biomedical research institute, korea institute of science and technology, seoul 02792, republic of korea. electronic address: iskim14@kist.re.kr.",translational oncology,transl oncol,1936-5233,1936-5233,4.5,4.2,ONCOLOGY|Q1|78/322,"korea university, korea institute of science and technology, ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, shiftbio, ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, korea institute of science and technology, ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, shiftbio, ku-kist graduate school of converging science and technology, korea university, korea institute of science and technology, asan medical center, university of ulsan college of medicine, dongguk university, korea institute of science and technology, korea university of science and technology, shiftbio, korea university, korea institute of science and technology, kyung hee university, korea university",Unknown,korea university,201–250,46.6,225.5,Low (0-50)

340,blood screening of femtomole level multiple alzheimer's disease biomarkers by metal isotopic dna walkers.,"aging is a critical global issue that contributes to the high incidence of alzheimer's disease (ad). blood screening emerges as the most promising measure for early diagnosis and intervention of ad due to its noninvasive and low cost. however, the practical application of ad blood screening confronts two significant challenges. first, due to the blood-brain barrier, the concentration of ad biomarkers in blood is much lower than that in cerebrospinal fluid. second, simultaneous quantitative analysis of multiple biomarkers is necessary due to the low specificity of individual biomarkers. herein, we propose dnazyme-based 3d dna walkers for the sensitive and multiplex detection of five ad-associated mirna biomarkers: hsa-mir-125b, hsa-mir-342-3p, hsa-mir-29b, hsa-mir-191-5p, and hsa-mir-7d-5. the dnazyme-based 3d dna walkers provide highly efficient and autonomous amplification of the minimal biomarkers' quantities. the walking-released metal isotopes <sup>89</sup>y, <sup>165</sup>ho, <sup>139</sup>la, <sup>140</sup>ce, and <sup>159</sup>tb can be sensitively detected by elemental mass spectrometry without any spectral overlap. the detection limit was achieved to be as low as 1.0 fmol. the proposed method was successfully applied to human serum samples with satisfactory spiked recoveries. with its high sensitivity and multiplexity capabilities, this metal isotope strategy may contribute to the early diagnosis and intervention of ad.",analytical chemistry,eng,2024,Nov,"Wang Yu, Zhou Jing, Chen Xue, Liu Rui, Lv Yi","key laboratory of green chemistry & technology, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, chengdu, sichuan 610064, china., analytical & testing center, sichuan university, chengdu 610064, china., key laboratory of green chemistry & technology, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, chengdu, sichuan 610064, china., key laboratory of green chemistry & technology, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, chengdu, sichuan 610064, china., key laboratory of green chemistry & technology, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, chengdu, sichuan 610064, china.",analytical chemistry,anal chem,0003-2700,1520-6882,6.7,6.5,"CHEMISTRY, ANALYTICAL|Q1|6/106","ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, sichuan university, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university, ministry of education, college of chemistry, sichuan university",blood screening,sichuan university,150,57.3,150.0,Medium (50-75)

344,kdm6b knockdown alleviates sleep deprivation-induced cerebrovascular lesions in app/ps1 mice by inhibiting parp16 expression.,"cerebral amyloid angiopathy (caa) is a neurological disorder in the elderly, involving the deposition of vascular amyloid-β (aβ). sleep deprivation (sd) causes memory deficits during caa. lysine specific demethylase 6b (kdm6b) is a histone h3 lysine 27-specific demethylase associated with neuronal injury and inflammation. however, the role of kdm6b in caa has yet to be studied. in the current study, the multi-platform over-water method was used to induce chronic sd in app/ps1 mice. pathological analysis revealed that sd exacerbated vascular lesions in this model, as manifested by extensive formation of aβ-positive deposits. in addition, sd led to a significant increase in the expression of kdm6b in the cerebral cortex of app/ps1 mice. next, the effect of kdm6b on caa progression was explored through loss of function. further experiments illustrated that kdm6b knockdown diminished sd-induced memory impairment, neuronal injury and vascular lesions in vivo. additionally, isolated primary cortical neurons were treated with 10 µm aβ<sub>1-42</sub> for 48 h to induce the cell model. as expected, knockdown of kdm6b inhibited the aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cytotoxicity in primary neurons. mechanistically, our results demonstrated that kdm6b knockdown downregulated poly (adp-ribose) polymerase16 (parp16) expression by increasing trimethylated lysine 27 on histone 3 (h3k27me3) levels, indicating that kdm6b epigenetically regulated parp16 expression. function recovery experiment results further proved that parp16 overexpression negated the effect of kdm6b knockdown on aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-induced cytotoxicity. overall, our findings uncover an unanticipated role of kdm6b in caa, and kdm6b may serve as a potential therapeutic target for caa. abbreviations: caa, cerebral amyloid angiopathy;

349,designed cell-penetrating peptide constructs for inhibition of pathogenic protein self-assembly.,"peptides possess a number of pharmacologically desirable properties, including greater chemical diversity than other biomolecule classes and the ability to selectively bind to specific targets with high potency, as well as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ease and low cost of production. consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing peptide-based therapeutics, including amyloid inhibitors. however, a major hindrance to the successful therapeutic application of peptides is their poor delivery to target tissues, cells or subcellular organelles. to overcome these issues, recent efforts have focused on engineering cell-penetrating peptide (cpp) antagonists of amyloidogenesis, which combine the attractive intrinsic properties of peptides with potent therapeutic effects (i.e., inhibition of amyloid formation and the associated cytotoxicity) and highly efficient delivery (to target tissue, cells, and organelles). this review highlights some promising cpp constructs designed to target amyloid aggregation associated with a diverse range of disorders, including alzheimer's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (or prion diseases), parkinson's disease, and cancer.",pharmaceutics,eng,2024,Nov,"Kalmouni Mona, Oh Yujeong, Alata Wael, Magzoub Mazin","biology program, division of science, new york university abu dhabi, saadiyat island campus, abu dhabi p.o. box 129188, united arab emirates., biology program, division of science, new york university abu dhabi, saadiyat island campus, abu dhabi p.o. box 129188, united arab emirates., biology program, division of science, new york university abu dhabi, saadiyat island campus, abu dhabi p.o. box 129188, united arab emirates., biology program, division of science, new york university abu dhabi, saadiyat island campus, abu dhabi p.o. box 129188, united arab emirates.",pharmaceutics,pharmaceutics,,1999-4923,4.9,5.5,PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACY|Q1|45/354,"new york university abu dhabi, united arab emirates, new york university abu dhabi, united arab emirates, new york university abu dhabi, united arab emirates, new york university abu dhabi, united arab emirates",Unknown,york university,351–400,32.4,375.5,Low (0-50)

351,the fundamental neurobiological mechanism of oxidative stress-related 4e-bp2 protein deamidation.,"memory impairment is caused by the absence of the 4e-bp2 protein in the brain. this protein undergoes deamidation spontaneously in the neurons. 4e-bp2 deamidation significantly alters protein synthesis in the neurons and affects the balance of protein production required for a healthy nervous system. any imbalance in protein production in the nervous system causes neurodegenerative diseases. discovering what causes 4e-bp2 deamidation will make it possible to control this balance of protein production and develop effective treatments against neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer's and parkinson's. the purpose of this work is to discover the neurobiological mechanism that causes the deamidation reaction in the 4e-bp2 protein by performing immunoblotting in the retinal ganglia, the optic nerve, the dorsal root ganglia, the sciatic nerve, and the whole brain, extracted via dissection from 2-month-old, wild-type male mice. the results show that axons and their unique properties cause neuron-specific 4e-bp2 deamidation in the nervous system, confirming conclusively that axons are the critical factors behind the fundamental neurobiological mechanism of 4e-bp2 protein deamidation.",international journal of molecular sciences,eng,2024,Nov,Joseph Davis,"faculty of medicine, mcgill university, montreal, qc h3a 0g4, canada.",international journal of molecular sciences,int j mol sci,1661-6596,1422-0067,4.9,5.6,"CHEMISTRY, MULTIDISCIPLINARY|Q2|67/230","faculty of medicine, mcgill university",Unknown,mcgill university,49,72.3,49.0,Medium (50-75)

360,a combinatorial approach with microneedle pretreatment and thermosensitive gel loaded with rivastigmine lipid nanoparticle formulation enables brain delivery via the trigeminal nerve.,"alzheimer's disease (ad) often leads to dementia, causing cognitive decline and increased care needs. rivastigmine (rv) is a key ad treatment, but its brain delivery is limited by the blood-brain barrier (bbb). aside from oral, olfactory, and intradermal injection (i.d.) routes, the application of polymeric microneedles via the trigeminal nerve on the facial skin as a pretreatment, followed by a solid lipid nanoparticle rv-loaded thermosensitive gel (pmn-sln-rv-tg), is an alternative to deal with the problems. this study aims to determine the optimal formula for pmn-sln-rv-tg application and assess its brain delivery ability compared to conventional routes. the optimum sln-rv formula had a particle size <200 nm and sustained release for 72 h, which was selected for the sln-rv-tg formulation. sln-rv-tg was transformed into a gel at normal skin temperature (32-37 °c), with good physical properties and nontoxic behavior. the ideal pmn formula was able to penetrate the dermal layer as an alternative to i.d. administration. <i>ex vivo</i> dermatokinetics showed significant improvement of pmn-sln-rv-tg application (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to without pmn application. <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetic studies on rats also revealed that the pmn-sln-rv-tg had superior pharmacokinetic parameters (<i>c</i><sub>max</sub>, auc, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>, and mrt) compared to other groups

363,recent studies on heterocyclic cholinesterase inhibitors against alzheimer's disease.,"alzheimer's disease is a progressive and neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment in emotion, language, memory and cognitive judgment. there are many factors related to alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid beta plaques (aβ) due to impaired metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (app), tau hyperphosphorylation and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles, and disruption of the cholinergic system. disruption of the cholinergic system responsible for cognitive function and memory processes is one of the important causes of alzheimer's disease. therefore, cholinesterase (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) inhibitors that maintain choline (acetylcholine and butyrylcholine) levels in the synaptic gap play an important role in the symptomatic treatment of alzheimer's disease. numerous studies have been carried out against alzheimer's disease involving acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. however, there are very few drugs (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil) approved as cholinesterase inhibitors. therefore, cholinesterase inhibitors are needed against alzheimer's disease. this review is focused on using heterocyclic rings that show remarkable cholinesterase inhibitory activity for alzheimer's disease. in this review, chemical structures and structure-activity relationships of recently reported cholinesterase inhibitors are emphasized. this review will give important ideas to medicinal chemists in the discovery and development of potent cholinesterase inhibitors in their future studies.",chemistry & biodiversity,eng,2024,Nov,Tok Fatih,"marmara universitesi eczacilik fakultesi, pharmaceutical chemistry, marmara university, faculty of pharmacy, department of pharmaceutical chemistry,, 34854 4/a, istanbul, turkey.",chemistry & biodiversity,chem biodivers,1612-1872,1612-1880,2.3,2.5,"CHEMISTRY, MULTIDISCIPLINARY|Q3|121/230","marmara universitesi, marmara university, faculty of pharmacy, department of pharmaceutical chemistry",numerous studies,marmara university,1501+,11.7,1501.0,Low (0-50)

365,"probing the potential mechanism of permethrin exposure on alzheimer's disease through enantiomer-specific network toxicology, multi-spectroscopic, and docking approaches.","latest observations indicated that exposure of organic environmental neurotoxins may increase the potential risk of alzheimer's diseases (ad). as a suspected food-derived risk factor, permethrin, composed of cis-isomer and trans-isomer, is widely used as a broad-spectrum pyrethroid insecticide in agricultural crops for the arthropod pests controlling. thus, evaluating the impact of permethrin exposure is of great importance to human health. in this study, we performed the toxicological network approach to decipher ad-related mechanisms of cis-permethrin and trans-permethrin. based on the toxicological network construction and central network topological analysis, human serum albumin (hsa) was selected as the core targets in ad-related developing. from the analysis of the steady state and time-resolved ﬂuorescence quenching of hsa in presence of permethrin mixture, it has been inferred that the nature of the quenching mainly originates from the dynamic modes. experimentally, the thermodynamic parameters revealed hydrophobic interactions and van der waals forces played a major role during quenching process. tryptophan synchronous ﬂuorescence spectra were blue shifted whereas the position of tyrosine synchronous spectra was red shifted during the complex formation. three-dimensional fluorescence together with ft-ir experiment confirmed that permethrin caused the secondary structure changes in hsa. to better understand the binding patterns between hsa and cis/trans -permethrin, theoretical calculation and molecular docking were implemented. according to the electrostatic potential map, the electrophilic attack region corresponds for electron rich oxygen atoms, while the nucleophilic attack regions were mainly located at over the benzene rings and methyl on cyclopropane ring of permethrins. docking results shown that cis-permethrin and trans-permethrin located in hydrophobic pocket nearby domain iia with the different binding affinity (-7.6 and -9.2 kcal/mol), which consistent with the competitive displacement experiment. all these findings generated in the present study facilitated the elucidation of the molecular mechanism details between permethrin mixture and hsa, which provided fresh insights into the links between environmental exposure and ad-related adverse health outcomes.",chemosphere,eng,2024,Nov,"Guan Tianzhu, Li Ning, Gao Ya, Gao Mingyuan, Hu Qin, Gao Yajun, Xiao Lixia, Yang Zhenquan, Liu Qiaoquan","school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china., school of food science and engineering, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225127, china. electronic address: yangzq@yzu.edu.cn., key laboratory of crop genomics and molecular breeding of jiangsu province, state key laboratory of hybrid rice, key laboratory of plant functional genomics of the ministry of education, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225009, china; jiangsu co-innovation center for modern production technology of grain crops, jiangsu key laboratory of crop genetics and physiology, yangzhou university, yangzhou 225009, china. electronic address: qqliu@yzu.edu.cn.",chemosphere,chemosphere,0045-6535,1879-1298,8.1,7.7,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES|Q1|32/358,"yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, yangzhou university, ministry of education, yangzhou university, yangzhou university",toxicological network approach,yangzhou university,501–600,24.6,550.5,Low (0-50)
366,"biological mechanism of sex differences in mental rotation: evidence from multimodal mri, transcriptomic and receptor/transporter data.","sex differences in mental rotation are a well-documented phenomenon in cognitive research, with implications for the differing prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (asd), alzheimer's disease (ad) and major depressive disorder (mdd) between the sexes. despite extensive documentation, the biological mechanism underpinning these differences remain elusive. this study aimed to elucidate neural, genetic, and molecular bases of these disparities in mental rotation by integrating data from multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (mri), transcriptomic and receptor/transporter. we first calculated the dynamic regional homogeneity (dreho), gray matter volume (gmv) and fractional anisotropy (fa) in voxel-wise manner and parceled them into 246 brain regions based on brainnetome atlas. subsequent analyses involved pearson correlations to examine the association between mental rotation performance and dreho/gmv/fa and two-sample t-tests to delineate gender differences in these indices. based on the above results, further mediation analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between sex, brain biomarkers and mental rotation. in addition, transcriptome-neuroimaging association analysis and correlation analysis between brain biomarkers and neurotransmitter receptor/transporter distribution were also performed to uncover genetic and molecular mechanisms contributing to the observed sex differences in mental rotation. we found correlations between mental rotation performance and dreho, gmv and fa of the inferior parietal lobule (ipl) and superior temporal gyrus (stg) and sex effects on these brain biomarkers. notably, the dreho of the left ipl mediated the relationship between sex and mental rotation. further correlation analysis revealed that the proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter pept2 (slc15a2) and interleukin 17 receptor d (il17rd) were associated with sex-related t-statistic maps and mental rotation-related r-statistic maps of dreho. moreover, γ-aminobutyric acid subtype a (gaba<sub>a</sub>) receptor availability was correlated with the r-statistic of dreho, while norepinephrine transporter (net) availability was correlated with its t-statistic. serial mediation models revealed the indirect effect of these genes on the r-statistic maps through the transporter/receptor and t-statistic maps. our findings provide novel insights into the biological mechanism underlying sex differences in mental rotation, identifying potential biomarkers for cognitive impairment and explaining variations in prevalence of certain mental disorders between the sexes. these results highlight the necessity of considering sex in research on mental health disorders.",neuroimage,eng,2024,Nov,"Long Haixia, Wu Hao, Sun Chaoliang, Xu Xinli, Yang Xu-Hua, Xiao Jie, Lv Mingqi, Chen Qiuju, Fan Ming","college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., zhejiang lab, zhongtai street, yuhang district, hangzhou 311100, china., college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., school of design and architecture, zhejiang university of technology, hangzhou 310023, china., institute of biomedical engineering and instrumentation, hangzhou dianzi university, hangzhou 310018, china. electronic address: ming.fan@hdu.edu.cn.",neuroimage,neuroimage,1053-8119,1095-9572,4.7,6.1,"RADIOLOGY, NUCLEAR MEDICINE & MEDICAL IMAGING|Q1|22/204","college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, college of computer science and technology, zhejiang university of technology, school of design and architecture, zhejiang university of technology, institute of biomedical engineering and instrumentation, hangzhou dianzi university",cognitive research,zhejiang university,55,75.3,55.0,High (75-100)

that perceptual constancy is maintained across patient groups despite variations in image sizes; and pareidolic misperceptions, to some extent, are stabilized on a digital format. our findings demonstrate a practical way of testing pareidolias on smartphones without compromising on the functionality of the test.",heliyon,eng,2024,Nov,"Revankar Gajanan S, Ozono Tatsuhiko, Suzuki Maki, Kanemoto Hideki, Furuya Kota, Shigenobu Kazue, Yoshiyama Kenji, Yamamoto Yuki, Ogasawara Issei, Yoshida Natsuki, Iwasaki Susumu, Saeki Chizu, Nishio Yoshiyuki, Nakatani Daisaku, Asai Kanako, Kajiyama Yuta, Shimizu Mikito, Hayashi Tatsuya, Taniguchi Seira, Suzuki Yu, Inada Rino, Taminato Tomoya, Nagai Yoshitaka, Hashimoto Mamoru, Ikeda Manabu, Mori Etsuro, Mochizuki Hideki, Nakata Ken","center for global health, department of medical innovation, osaka university hospital, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, united graduate school of child development, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., center for global health, department of medical innovation, osaka university hospital, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of health and sport sciences, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of health and sport sciences, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of health and sport sciences, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, united graduate school of child development, osaka university, osaka, japan., center for global health, department of medical innovation, osaka university hospital, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, kawasaki medical school, okayama, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of health and sport sciences, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, kindai university faculty of medicine, osaka, japan., department of neurology, kindai university faculty of medicine, osaka, japan., department of neurology, kindai university faculty of medicine, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, kindai university faculty of medicine, osaka, japan., department of psychiatry, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, united graduate school of child development, osaka university, osaka, japan., department of neurology, graduate school of medicine, osaka university, osaka, japan., center for global health, department of medical innovation, osaka university hospital, osaka, japan.",heliyon,heliyon,,2405-8440,3.4,3.9,MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES|Q1|28/134,"osaka university, osaka university, united graduate school of child development, osaka university, osaka university, center for global health, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, united graduate school of child development, osaka university, center for global health, osaka university, osaka university, kawasaki medical school, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, osaka university, kindai university faculty of medicine",baseline mmse assessments,osaka university,175,65.7,175.0,Medium (50-75)

374,multi-scale multimodal deep learning framework for alzheimer's disease diagnosis.,"multimodal neuroimaging data, including magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and positron emission tomography (pet), provides complementary information about the brain that can aid in alzheimer's disease (ad) diagnosis. however, most existing deep learning methods still rely on patch-based extraction from neuroimaging data, which typically yields suboptimal performance due to its isolation from the subsequent network and does not effectively capture the varying scales of structural changes in the cerebrum. moreover, these methods often simply concatenate multimodal data, ignoring the interactions between them that can highlight discriminative regions and thereby improve the diagnosis of ad. to tackle these issues, we develop a multimodal and multi-scale deep learning model that effectively leverages the interaction between the multimodal and multiscale of the neuroimaging data. first, we employ a convolutional neural network to embed each scale of the multimodal images. second, we propose multimodal scale fusion mechanisms that utilize both multi-head self-attention and multi-head cross-attention, which capture global relations among the embedded features and weigh each modality's contribution to another, and hence enhancing feature extraction and interaction between each scale of mri and pet images. third, we introduce a cross-modality fusion module that includes a multi-head cross-attention to fuse mri and pet data at different scales and promote global features from the previous attention layers. finally, all the features from every scale are fused to discriminate between the different stages of ad. we evaluated our proposed method on the adni dataset, and the results show that our model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.",computers in biology and medicine,eng,2024,Nov,"Abdelaziz Mohammed, Wang Tianfu, Anwaar Waqas, Elazab Ahmed","national-regional key technology engineering laboratory for medical ultrasound, guangdong key laboratory for biomedical measurements and ultrasound imaging, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, shenzhen, 518060, china; department of communications and electronics, delta higher institute for engineering and technology (dhiet), mansoura, 35516, egypt., national-regional key technology engineering laboratory for medical ultrasound, guangdong key laboratory for biomedical measurements and ultrasound imaging, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, shenzhen, 518060, china. electronic address: tfwang@szu.edu.cn., medical ultrasound image computing (music) lab, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, shenzhen, 518060, china., national-regional key technology engineering laboratory for medical ultrasound, guangdong key laboratory for biomedical measurements and ultrasound imaging, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, shenzhen, 518060, china; computer science department, misr higher institute of commerce and computers, mansoura, 35516, egypt.",computers in biology and medicine,comput biol med,0010-4825,1879-0534,7.0,6.7,MATHEMATICAL & COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY|Q1|2/65,"school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, delta higher institute for engineering and technology (dhiet), school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, school of biomedical engineering, health science center, shenzhen university, misr higher institute of commerce and computers",Unknown,shenzhen university,351–400,34.3,375.5,Low (0-50)
375,angptl4-mediated microglial lipid droplet accumulation: bridging alzheimer's disease and obesity.,"increasing evidence suggests that metabolic disorders such as obesity are implicated in the development of alzheimer's disease (ad). the pathological buildup of lipids in microglia is regarded as a key indicator in brain aging and the progression of ad, yet the mechanisms behind this process remain uncertain. the adipokine angptl4 is strongly associated with obesity and is thought to play a role in the advancement of neurodegenerative diseases. this study utilized rna sequencing to identify differential expression in lipid-accumulating bv2 microglia and investigated the potential mechanism through angptl4 overexpression in bv2. subsequently, animal models and clinical data were employed to further explore alterations in circulating angptl4 levels in ad. rna sequencing results indicated a correlation between angptl4 and microglial lipid accumulation. the overexpression of angptl4 in microglia resulted in increased secretion of inflammatory factors, elevated oxidative stress levels, and diminished antiviral capacity. furthermore, when simulating the coexistence of ad and obesity through combined treatment with amyloid-beta 1-42 peptide (aβ) and free fatty acids (ffa) in vitro, we observed a notable upregulation of angptl4 expression, highlighting its potential role in the interplay between ad and obesity. in vivo experiments, we also observed a significant increase in angptl4 expression in the hippocampus and plasma of app/ps1 mice compared to wild-type controls. this was accompanied by heightened microglial activation and reduced expression of longevity-related genes in the hippocampus. clinical data from the uk biobank indicated that plasma angptl4 levels are elevated in patients with ad when compared to healthy controls. moreover, significantly higher angptl4 levels were observed in obese ad patients relative to their non-obese counterparts. our findings suggest that angptl4-mediated microglial aging may serve as a crucial link between ad and obesity, proposing angptl4 as a potential biomarker for ad.",neurobiology of disease,eng,2024,Nov,"Li Nan, Wang Xiaojun, Lin Ruilang, Yang Fuxia, Chang Hung-Chen, Gu Xuchao, Shu Jun, Liu Guidong, Yu Yongfu, Wei Wenshi, Bao Zhijun","department of neurology, huadong hospital affiliated to fudan university, shanghai 200040, china;

378,glp-1 receptor signaling restores aquaporin 4 subcellular polarization in reactive astrocytes and promotes amyloid β clearance in a mouse model of alzheimer's disease.,"the physiological actions of a gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1), in alzheimer's disease (ad) brain remain poorly understood, although glp-1 receptor (glp-1r) expression in this organ has been shown in several experimental studies. therefore, we explored whether the glp-1r signaling promotes the clearance of amyloid β (aβ) (1-42) which is a core pathological hallmark of ad, focusing on the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (aqp4) localized to astrocyte endfeet perivascular membranes in intact brain. first, we confirmed that glp1r mrna is predominantly expressed at perivascular site of astrocytes in normal mouse cerebral cortex through in situ hybridization analysis. next, we observed that 20-week subcutaneous administration of a glp-1r agonist (glp-1ra) liraglutide significantly reduced aβ (1-42) accumulation in the cerebral cortex and improved spatial working memory in an ad mouse model, app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice. furthermore, our current data revealed that the 4-week liraglutide treatment relocalized subcellular aqp4 in morphologically injured reactive astrocytes of app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice to the cell surface perivascular site through pka-mediated aqp4 phosphorylation. such translocation of phosphorylated aqp4 to astrocyte cell surface following incubation with liraglutide was observed also in the present in vitro study using the cell line in which aqp4 cdna was introduced into immortalized human astrocyte. these results suggest that enhanced intracerebral glp-1r signaling following peripheral administration of glp-1ra restores aqp4 subcellular polarization in reactive astrocytes and would promote aβ excretion possibly through increasing aqp4-mediated intracerebral water flux in the brain in ad.",biochemical and biophysical research communications,eng,2024,Nov,"Sasaki Kana, Fujita Hiroki, Sato Takehiro, Kato Shunske, Takahashi Yuya, Takeshita Yukio, Kanda Takashi, Saito Takashi, Saido Takamori C, Hattori Satoko, Hozumi Yasukazu, Yamada Yuichiro, Waki Hironori","department of metabolism and endocrinology, akita university graduate school of medicine, akita, japan., department of metabolism and endocrinology, akita university graduate school of medicine, akita, japan. electronic address: hirofuji@gipc.akita-u.ac.jp., department of metabolism and endocrinology, akita university graduate school of medicine, akita, japan., department of metabolism and endocrinology, akita university graduate school of medicine, akita, japan;

394,the role of abcg2 in health and disease: linking cancer therapy resistance and other disorders.,"all biological systems have adenosine triphosphate (atp) binding cassette (abc) transporters, one of the significant protein superfamilies involved in transport across membranes. abc transporters have been implicated in the etiology of diseases like metabolic disorders, cancer, and alzheimer's disease. atp-binding cassette superfamily g member 2 (abcg2), one of the abc transporters, is necessary for the atp-dependent efflux of several endogenous and exogenous substances. consequently, it maintained cellular homeostasis and shielded tissue from xenobiotic substances. abcg2 was initially identified in an adriamycin-selected breast cancer cell line (mcf-7/adrvp) and was linked to the emergence of multidrug resistance (mdr) in cancerous cells. under many pathophysiological conditions, including inflammation, disease pathology, tissue injury, infection, and in response to xenobiotics and endogenous substances, the expression of abcg2 undergoes alterations that result in modifications in its function and activity. genetic variants in the abcg2 transporter can potentially impact its expression and function, contributing to the development of many disorders. this review aimed to illustrate the impact of abcg2 expression and its variants on oral drug bioavailability, mdr in specific cancer cells, explore the relationship between abcg2 expression and other disorders such as gout, alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and erythropoietic protoporphyria, and demonstrate the influence of various synthetic and natural compounds in regulating abcg2 expression.",life sciences,eng,2024,Nov,"El-Ashmawy Nahla E, Al-Ashmawy Ghada M, Hamada Omnia B, Khedr Naglaa F","tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, department of biochemistry, tanta postal code: 31527, egypt; the british university in egypt, faculty of pharmacy, department of pharmacology & biochemistry, el sherouk city, cairo postal code: 11837, egypt. electronic address: nahla.elashmawi@pharm.tanta.edu.eg., tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, department of biochemistry, tanta postal code: 31527, egypt; alsalam university in egypt, faculty of pharmacy, department of biochemistry, kafr el zayat, egypt. electronic address: ghadaashmawy@pharm.tanta.edu.eg., tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, department of biochemistry, tanta postal code: 31527, egypt. electronic address: omnia.hamada@pharm.tanta.edu.eg., tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, department of biochemistry, tanta postal code: 31527, egypt. electronic address: naglaa.khedr@pharm.tanta.edu.eg.",life sciences,life sci,0024-3205,1879-0631,5.2,5.3,PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACY|Q1|40/354,"tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, the british university in egypt, faculty of pharmacy, tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, alsalam university in egypt, faculty of pharmacy, tanta university, faculty of pharmacy, tanta university, faculty of pharmacy",Unknown,tanta university,1001–1200,9.1,1100.5,Low (0-50)
395,neuronal fatty acid-binding protein enhances autophagy and suppresses amyloid-β pathology in a drosophila model of alzheimer's disease.,"fatty acid-binding proteins (fabps) are small cytoplasmic proteins involved in intracellular lipid transport and bind free fatty acids, cholesterol, and retinoids. fabp3, the major neuronal fabp in the adult brain, is upregulated in the csf of patients with alzheimer's disease (ad). however, the precise role of neuronal fabps in ad pathogenesis remains unclear. this study investigates the contribution of fabp, the drosophila homolog of fabp3 and fabp7, to amyloid β (aβ) pathology using a drosophila model. neuronal knockdown of fabp shortened the lifespan of flies and increased age-related protein aggregates in the brain. in an ad model, fabp knockdown in neurons increased aβ accumulation and aβ-induced neurodegeneration, whereas fabp overexpression ameliorated aβ pathology. notably, fabp overexpression stimulated autophagy, which was inhibited by the knockdown of eip75b, the drosophila homolog of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar). the ppar activator rosiglitazone restored autophagy impaired by fabp knockdown and reduced fabp knockdown-induced increased aβ aggregation and cell death. furthermore, knockdown of either fabp or eip75b in the wing imaginal disc or adult fly brain reduced the expression of atg6 and atg8a. additionally, treatment of the fabp knockdown ad model flies with polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid or linoleic acid, partially alleviated cell death in the developing eye, restored impaired autophagy flux, reduced aβ aggregation, and attenuated aβ-induced cell death. our results suggest that drosophila fabp plays an important role in maintaining protein homeostasis during aging and protects neurons from aβ-induced cell death by enhancing autophagy through the ppar pathway. these findings highlight the potential importance of neuronal fabp function in ad pathogenesis.",plos genetics,eng,2024,Nov,"Jang Seokhui, Choi Byoungyun, Lim Chaejin, Kim Minkyoung, Lee Ji-Eun, Lee Hyungi, Baek Eunji, Cho Kyoung Sang","department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea.",plos genetics,plos genet,1553-7404,1553-7404,4.0,4.9,GENETICS & HEREDITY|Q1|40/191,"department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university",drosophila model,konkuk university,601–800,37.6,700.5,Low (0-50)

409,supramolecular arrangements in human amyloid tissues using saxs.,"amyloid diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates in human tissues, pose significant challenges for both diagnosis and treatment. protein aggregations known as amyloids are linked to several neurodegenerative conditions including alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease, and systemic amyloidosis. the key goal of this research is to employ small-angle x-ray scattering (saxs) to examine the supramolecular structures of amyloid aggregates in human tissues. we present the structural analysis of amyloid using saxs, which is employed directly to analyze thin tissue samples without damaging the tissues. this technique provides size and shape information of fibrils, which can be used to generate low-resolution 2d models. the present study investigates the structural changes in amyloid fibril axial d-spacing and scattering intensity in different human tissues, including kidney, heart, thyroid, and others, while also accounting for the presence of triglycerides in these tissues. tissue structural components were examined at momentum transfer values between q = 0.2 nm<sup>-1</sup> and 1.5 nm<sup>-1</sup>. the d-spacing is a critical parameter in saxs that provides information about the periodic distances between structures within a sample. from the supramolecular saxs patterns, the axial d-spacing of fibrils in amyloid tissues is prominent and exists within the 3rd to 10th order, compared to that of healthy tissues which do not have notable peak orders. the axial period of fibrils in amyloid tissues is within the scattering vector range 57.40-64.64 nm<sup>-1</sup> while in normal tissues the range is between 60.68 and 61.41 nm<sup>-1</sup>, which is 3.0 nm<sup>-1</sup> smaller than amyloid-containing tissues. differences in d-spacing are often correlate with distinct pathological mechanisms or stages of disease progression. the application of saxs to investigate amyloid structures in human tissues has enormous potential to further knowledge of amyloid disorders. this work will open the path for novel diagnostic instruments and therapeutic strategies meant to reduce the burden of amyloid-related diseases by offering a thorough structural examination of amyloid aggregates.",biophysical chemistry,eng,2025,Jan,"Ihsan N S Mohd Nor, Abdul Sani S F, Looi L M, Pathmanathan Dharini, Cheah P L, Chiew S F, Chio-Srichan Sirinart, Soontaranon Siriwat, Bradley D A","department of physics, faculty of science, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia., department of physics, faculty of science, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia. electronic address: s.fairus@um.edu.my., department of pathology, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia., institute of mathematical sciences, faculty of science, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia., department of pathology, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia., department of pathology, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, 50603 kuala lumpur, malaysia., synchrotron light research, institute (public organization), nakhon ratchasima 30000, thailand., synchrotron light research, institute (public organization), nakhon ratchasima 30000, thailand., applied physics and radiation technologies group, ccdcu, school of engineering and technology, sunway university, 47500 bandar sunway, selangor, malaysia; school of mathematics and physics, university of surrey, guildford gu2 7xh, uk.",biophysical chemistry,biophys chem,0301-4622,1873-4200,3.3,2.7,"CHEMISTRY, PHYSICAL|Q2|82/178","university of malaya, university of malaya, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, institute of mathematical sciences, university of malaya, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, faculty of medicine, university of malaya, synchrotron light research, institute (public organization), synchrotron light research, institute (public organization), ccdcu, school of engineering and technology, sunway university, university of surrey",Unknown,sunway university,601–800,14.6,700.5,Low (0-50)

413,"3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid methyl ester isolated from polygala tenuifolia enhances hippocampal ltp through pka and calcium-permeable ampa receptor.","alzheimer's disease (ad) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal death due to extracellular deposition of amyloid β (aβ) and intracellular deposition of tau proteins. recently approved antibody drugs targeting aβ have been shown to slow the progression of the disease, but they have minimal effects on cognitive improvement. therefore, there is a need to develop drugs with cognitive-enhancing effects that can be used in conjunction with these antibody treatments. in this study, we investigated whether polygala tenuifolia (pt), traditionally known for its cognitive-enhancing effects, can improve synaptic plasticity and identified its active components and mechanisms. pt demonstrated a dose-dependent effect in enhancing long-term potentiation (ltp), and among its components, 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid methyl ester (tmca) showed a similar ltp-enhancing effect. tmca increased the phosphorylation of the glua1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors and increased the amount of glua1 on the synapse without affecting the amount of glua2. additionally, the increase in glua1 induced by tmca was inhibited by a pka inhibitor. consistent with these results, the enhancement of ltp by tmca was inhibited by a glua1 antagonist and a pka inhibitor. in silico molecular docking experiments confirmed that tmca binds to pka. finally, we confirmed the ltp-enhancing effect of tmca in hippocampal slices from 5xfad mice. these results suggest that pt and its active component, tmca, can interact with pka to enhance ltp, indicating the potential for improving cognitive function in ad patients.",biochemical pharmacology,eng,2024,Nov,"Lee Yehee, Jeon Jieun, Son So-Ri, Cho Eunbi, Moon Somin, Park A Young, Chae Hye Ji, Bae Ho Jung, Moon Minho, Jeon Se Jin, Jang Dae Sik, Kim Dong Hyun","department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: yehee224@naver.com., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: ji6785@naver.com., department of biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, graduate school, kyung hee university, seoul, 02447, republic of korea. electronic address: allosori@khu.ac.kr., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: bee2634@naver.com., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: ans5346@naver.com., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: khg99665@naver.com., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: b304853@naver.com., agriculture and life science research institute, kangwon national university, chuncheon 24341, republic of korea. electronic address: baehj321@kangwon.ac.kr., department of biochemistry, college of medicine, konyang university, daejeon 35365, republic of korea. electronic address: hominmoon@konyang.ac.kr., department of pharmacology, college of medicine, hallym university, gangwon, republic of korea. electronic address: sjinjeon@hallym.ac.kr., department of biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, graduate school, kyung hee university, seoul, 02447, republic of korea. electronic address: dsjang@khu.ac.kr., department of advanced translational medicine, graduate school, konkuk university, 120 neungdong-ro, gwangjin-gu, seoul 05029, republic of korea; department of pharmacology, college of medicine, konkuk university, chungju 27478, republic of korea; institute of biomedical sciences & technology, konkuk university, seoul 05029, republic of korea. electronic address: mose79@kku.ac.kr.",biochemical pharmacology,biochem pharmacol,0006-2952,1873-2968,5.3,5.2,PHARMACOLOGY & PHARMACY|Q1|34/354,"konkuk university, konkuk university, kyung hee university, konkuk university, konkuk university, konkuk university, konkuk university, kangwon national university, konyang university, hallym university, kyung hee university, konkuk university",Unknown,konkuk university,601–800,37.6,700.5,Low (0-50)

427,social death of older adults residing in nursing homes in finland.,"social death refers to situations in which individuals become socially excluded from social interaction or are considered socially insignificant. social death is about losing roles, relationships, and eventually identity in the eyes of others. when becoming a permanent resident in a nursing home, older adults face an increased risk of social death. however, empirical research on social death and its manifestations in nursing homes is still scarce. the aim of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of social death by interviewing family members (n = 19) of older people living in nursing homes in finland. a theory-driven thematic analysis of family members' interviews revealed two cross-cutting themes that were linked to social death in nursing homes. we discovered that 1) the transition to a nursing home significantly narrowed the older adults' social environment and 2) dementia seemed to affect all aspects of older adults' social life and social agency negatively. furthermore, four main mechanisms of social death in nursing homes were 1) losses associated with decline of physical and mental health, 2) loss of social identity, 3) isolation and lack of social connectedness, and 4) lack of quality of care. it seems that nursing home residents, especially those with advanced dementia, face social death because they are not seen as persons who are entitled to social roles and meaningful activities. thus, there is an urgent need to improve the social connectedness of all older adults living in care facilities, with particular attention to those with memory loss. based on these results, we provide checklists for nursing professionals and all citizens to restore the social value of older persons.",journal of aging studies,eng,2024,Dec,"Paananen Jenny, Kulmala Jenni, Pirhonen Jari","department of nursing science, university of turku, finland. electronic address: jenny.paananen@utu.fi., faculty of social sciences, tampere university, finland. electronic address: jenni.kulmala@tuni.fi., faculty of social sciences, tampere university, finland; faculty of social sciences, university of helsinki, finland. electronic address: jari.pirhonen@helsinki.fi.",journal of aging studies,j aging stud,0890-4065,1879-193X,1.8,2.3,GERONTOLOGY|Q2|23/47,"university of turku, faculty of social sciences, tampere university, faculty of social sciences, tampere university, faculty of social sciences, university of helsinki",empirical research,tampere university,301–350,38.4,325.5,Low (0-50)

433,advancing prediction of age-related vascular cognitive impairment based on peripheral and retinal vascular health in a pilot study: a novel comprehensive assessment developed for a prospective workplace-based cohort (the semmelweis study).,"with a growing elderly population in the european union, age-related diseases associated with unhealthy aging pose increasing public health challenges, including a loss of independence and heightened societal burdens. the semmelweis study, a prospective occupational cohort study in hungary, seeks to identify determinants of unhealthy aging, focusing on the complex relationship between lifestyle, environmental, occupational factors, and the development of chronic age-associated diseases, including age-related vascular cognitive impairment (vci). the primary objective of this pilot study was to establish a robust, high-throughput assessment methodology to comprehensively evaluate both peripheral and cerebrovascular health to provide a solid foundation for the forthcoming semmelweis study framework. the study involved 49 participants aged 23 to 87 years, and it assessed multi-domain cognitive performance through an automated battery of tests (cantab). vascular health was comprehensively evaluated using laser speckle contrast imaging (lsci), flow-mediated dilation (fmd), static and dynamic retinal vessel analysis (sva, dva), and measurements of vascular stiffness. the retinal microvasculature, which closely mirrors the cerebral circulation in anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology, provided a unique window for examination. optical imaging through sva and dva enables the identification of structural and functional changes in the central nervous system's microcirculation, which are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of vci. subsequently, the collected measures were integrated into vascular health indices using principal component analysis (pca) and the relationship to the age and cognitive status of study participants was explored. these comprehensive vascular health indices demonstrated a correlation not only with age but also with cognitive performance. this methodology holds promise for providing novel insights into the intricate interplay between vascular and cognitive health within the context of the semmelweis study.",geroscience,eng,2024,Nov,"Csipo Tamas, Lipecz Agnes, Mukli Peter, Péterfi

442,the importance of gut microbiota on choline metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases.,"the gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that influences digestion, immune response, metabolism, and has been linked to health and well-being. choline is essential for neurotransmitters, lipid transport, cell-membrane signaling, methyl-group metabolism and is believed to have neuroprotective properties. it is found in two forms, water-soluble and lipid-soluble, and its metabolism is different. long-term choline deficiency is associated with many diseases, and supplements are prescribed for improved health. choline supplements can improve cognitive function in adults but not significantly. choline is a precursor of phospholipids and an acetylcholine neurotransmitter precursor and can be generated de novo from phosphatidylcholine via phosphatidylethanolamine-n-methyltransferase and choline oxidase. choline supplementation has been found to have a beneficial effect on patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as alzheimer's disease (ad), by increasing amyloid-β, thioflavin s, and tau hyper-phosphorylation. choline supplementation has been shown to reduce amyloid-plaque load and develop spatial memory in an app/ps1 mice model of ad. choline is necessary for normative and improved function of brain pathways and can reduce amyloid-β deposition and microgliosis. clinical research suggests that early neurodegenerative diseases (nds) can benefit from a combination of choline supplements and the drugs currently used to treat nds in order to improve memory performance and synaptic functioning.",biomolecules,eng,2024,Oct,"Eslami Majid, Alibabaei Farnaz, Babaeizad Ali, Banihashemian Seyedeh Zahra, Mazandarani Mahdi, Hoseini Aref, Ramezankhah Mohammad, Oksenych Valentyn, Yousefi Bahman","department of bacteriology and virology, semnan university of medical sciences, semnan 35134, iran., student research committee, school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, semnan 35134, iran., school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, semnan 35134, iran., school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, semnan 35134, iran., endocrinology and metabolism research center, faculty of medicine, tehran university of medical sciences, tehran 11369, iran., student research committee, school of medicine, mazandaran university of medical sciences, sari 49414, iran., student research committee, faculty of medicine, babol university of medical sciences, babol 47134, iran., department of clinical science, university of bergen, 5020 bergen, norway., cancer research center, faculty of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, semnan 35134, iran.",biomolecules,biomolecules,,2218-273X,4.8,5.4,BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY|Q1|67/313,"semnan university of medical sciences, school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, school of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences, faculty of medicine, tehran university of medical sciences, school of medicine, mazandaran university of medical sciences, faculty of medicine, babol university of medical sciences, university of bergen, faculty of medicine, semnan university of medical sciences",clinical research,semnan university,1001–1200,12.8,1100.5,Low (0-50)

445,a combinatorial approach with microneedle pretreatment and thermosensitive gel loaded with rivastigmine lipid nanoparticle formulation enables brain delivery via the trigeminal nerve.,"alzheimer's disease (ad) often leads to dementia, causing cognitive decline and increased care needs. rivastigmine (rv) is a key ad treatment, but its brain delivery is limited by the blood-brain barrier (bbb). aside from oral, olfactory, and intradermal injection (i.d.) routes, the application of polymeric microneedles via the trigeminal nerve on the facial skin as a pretreatment, followed by a solid lipid nanoparticle rv-loaded thermosensitive gel (pmn-sln-rv-tg), is an alternative to deal with the problems. this study aims to determine the optimal formula for pmn-sln-rv-tg application and assess its brain delivery ability compared to conventional routes. the optimum sln-rv formula had a particle size <200 nm and sustained release for 72 h, which was selected for the sln-rv-tg formulation. sln-rv-tg was transformed into a gel at normal skin temperature (32-37 °c), with good physical properties and nontoxic behavior. the ideal pmn formula was able to penetrate the dermal layer as an alternative to i.d. administration. <i>ex vivo</i> dermatokinetics showed significant improvement of pmn-sln-rv-tg application (<i>p</i> < 0.05) compared to without pmn application. <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetic studies on rats also revealed that the pmn-sln-rv-tg had superior pharmacokinetic parameters (<i>c</i><sub>max</sub>, auc, <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub>, and mrt) compared to other groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). radiolabeling sln-rv with <sup>99m</sup>tc showed good physical properties, with a radiochemical yield of >95%. <i>in vivo</i> distribution studies of pmn-sln-rv-tg application exhibited a higher brain:blood ratio than i.v. administration after 5 h, as well as being safe for the brain due to a good histological profile. these results show that pmn-sln-rv-tg application via

448,microglial cannabinoid receptor type ii stimulation improves cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in alzheimer's disease mice by controlling astrocyte activation.,"alzheimer's disease (ad) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (aβ) and phosphorylated tau. neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by glial activation, plays an important role in ad progression. although there is growing evidence for the anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective effects of the cannabinoid system modulation, the detailed mechanism remains unclear. to address these issues, we analyzed the expression levels of cannabinoid receptor type ii (cnr2/cb2) in app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice and human ad precuneus, which is vulnerable to amyloid deposition in ad, and the effects of jwh 133, a selective cb2 agonist, on neuroinflammation in primary glial cells and neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice. the levels of cnr2/cb2 were upregulated in microglia isolated from the cerebral cortex of app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice. cnr2 expression was also increased in rnas derived from human precuneus with advanced ad pathology. chronic oral administration of jwh 133 significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairment of app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice without neuropsychiatric side effects. microglia and astrocyte mrnas were directly isolated from the mouse cerebral cortex by magnetic-activated cell sorting, and the gene expression was determined by quantitative pcr. jwh 133 administration significantly decreased reactive astrocyte markers and microglial c1q, an inducer for the reactive astrocytes in app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice. in addition, jwh133 administration inhibited the expression of p-stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in astrocytes in app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice. furthermore, jwh 133 administration suppressed dystrophic presynaptic terminals surrounding amyloid plaques. in conclusion, stimulation of microglial cb2 ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in app<sup>nl-g-f/nl-g-f</sup> mice by controlling astrocyte activation and inducing beneficial neuroinflammation, and our study has implications that cb2 may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of ad and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases involving neuroinflammation.",cell death & disease,eng,2024,Nov,"Sobue Akira, Komine Okiru, Endo Fumito, Kakimi Chihiro, Miyoshi Yuka, Kawade Noe, Watanabe Seiji, Saito Yuko, Murayama Shigeo, Saido Takaomi C, Saito Takashi, Yamanaka Koji","department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., brain bank for aging research (neuropathology), tokyo metropolitan geriatric hospital and institute of gerontology, tokyo, 173-0015, japan., brain bank for aging research (neuropathology), tokyo metropolitan geriatric hospital and institute of gerontology, tokyo, 173-0015, japan., laboratory for proteolytic neuroscience, riken center for brain science, saitama, 351-0198, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan., department of neuroscience and pathobiology, research institute of environmental medicine, nagoya university, aichi, 464-8601, japan. yamanaka.koji.p4@f.mail.nagoya-u.ac.jp.",cell death & disease,cell death dis,2041-4889,2041-4889,8.1,8.6,CELL BIOLOGY|Q1|33/205,"nagoya university, nagoya university, nagoya university, nagoya university, nagoya university, nagoya university, nagoya university, brain bank for aging research (neuropathology), tokyo metropolitan geriatric hospital and institute of gerontology, tokyo metropolitan geriatric hospital and institute of gerontology, riken center for brain science, nagoya university, nagoya university",Unknown,nagoya university,201–250,55.7,225.5,Medium (50-75)

468,neuronal fatty acid-binding protein enhances autophagy and suppresses amyloid-β pathology in a drosophila model of alzheimer's disease.,"fatty acid-binding proteins (fabps) are small cytoplasmic proteins involved in intracellular lipid transport and bind free fatty acids, cholesterol, and retinoids. fabp3, the major neuronal fabp in the adult brain, is upregulated in the csf of patients with alzheimer's disease (ad). however, the precise role of neuronal fabps in ad pathogenesis remains unclear. this study investigates the contribution of fabp, the drosophila homolog of fabp3 and fabp7, to amyloid β (aβ) pathology using a drosophila model. neuronal knockdown of fabp shortened the lifespan of flies and increased age-related protein aggregates in the brain. in an ad model, fabp knockdown in neurons increased aβ accumulation and aβ-induced neurodegeneration, whereas fabp overexpression ameliorated aβ pathology. notably, fabp overexpression stimulated autophagy, which was inhibited by the knockdown of eip75b, the drosophila homolog of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (ppar). the ppar activator rosiglitazone restored autophagy impaired by fabp knockdown and reduced fabp knockdown-induced increased aβ aggregation and cell death. furthermore, knockdown of either fabp or eip75b in the wing imaginal disc or adult fly brain reduced the expression of atg6 and atg8a. additionally, treatment of the fabp knockdown ad model flies with polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid or linoleic acid, partially alleviated cell death in the developing eye, restored impaired autophagy flux, reduced aβ aggregation, and attenuated aβ-induced cell death. our results suggest that drosophila fabp plays an important role in maintaining protein homeostasis during aging and protects neurons from aβ-induced cell death by enhancing autophagy through the ppar pathway. these findings highlight the potential importance of neuronal fabp function in ad pathogenesis.",plos genetics,eng,2024,Nov,"Jang Seokhui, Choi Byoungyun, Lim Chaejin, Kim Minkyoung, Lee Ji-Eun, Lee Hyungi, Baek Eunji, Cho Kyoung Sang","department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea., department of biological sciences, konkuk university, seoul, republic of korea.",plos genetics,plos genet,1553-7404,1553-7404,4.0,4.9,GENETICS & HEREDITY|Q1|40/191,"department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university, department of biological sciences, konkuk university",drosophila model,konkuk university,601–800,37.6,700.5,Low (0-50)

478,different amyloid β42 preparations induce different cell death pathways in the model of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells.,"amyloid β42 (aβ42) plays a decisive role in the pathology of alzheimer's disease. the aβ42 peptide can aggregate into various supramolecular structures, with oligomers being the most toxic form. however, different aβ species that cause different effects have been described. many cell death pathways can be activated in connection with aβ action, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, ferroptosis, alterations in mitophagy, autophagy, and endo/lysosomal functions. in this study, we used a model of differentiated sh-sy5y cells and applied two different aβ42 preparations for 2 and 4 days. although we found no difference in the shape and size of aβ species prepared by two different methods (naoh or nh<sub>4</sub>oh for aβ solubilization), we observed strong differences in their effects. treatment of cells with naoh-aβ42 mainly resulted in damage of mitochondrial function and increased production of reactive oxygen species, whereas application of nh<sub>4</sub>oh-aβ42 induced necroptosis and first steps of apoptosis, but also caused an increase in protective hsp27. moreover, the two aβ42 preparations differed in the mechanism of interaction with the cells, with the effect of naoh-aβ42 being dependent on monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (gm1) content, whereas the effect of nh<sub>4</sub>oh-aβ42 was independent of gm1. this suggests that, although both preparations were similar in size, minor differences in secondary/tertiary structure are likely to strongly influence the resulting processes. our work reveals, at least in part, one of the possible causes of the inconsistency in the data observed in different studies on aβ-toxicity pathways.",cellular & molecular biology letters,eng,2024,Nov,"Özdemir Alp Yigit, Hofbauerová Kateřina, Kopecký Vladimír, Novotný Jiří, Rudajev Vladimír","department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university, viničná 7, 12844, prague 2, czech republic., institute of physics, faculty of mathematics and physics, charles university, ke karlovu 5, 12116, prague 2, czech republic., institute of physics, faculty of mathematics and physics, charles university, ke karlovu 5, 12116, prague 2, czech republic., department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university, viničná 7, 12844, prague 2, czech republic., department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university, viničná 7, 12844, prague 2, czech republic. rudajev@natur.cuni.cz.",cellular & molecular biology letters,cell mol biol lett,1425-8153,1689-1392,9.2,8.1,CELL BIOLOGY|Q1|29/205,"department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university, institute of physics, faculty of mathematics and physics, charles university, institute of physics, faculty of mathematics and physics, charles university, department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university, department of physiology, faculty of sciences, charles university",Unknown,charles university,401–500,33.1,450.5,Low (0-50)

509,cerebral ischemic injury impairs autophagy and exacerbates cognitive impairment in app/ps1 mice.,"autophagy plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of alzheimer's disease (ad). oxidative stress and neuroinflammation involved in autophagy are associated with the cerebral ischemia-induced exacerbation of cognitive deficits in individuals with ad. app/ps1 mice underwent bilateral common carotid artery clamping for 15 min. the degrees of aβ deposition, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal and synaptic loss after cerebral ischemia were detected. autophagy levels were assessed by rt-qpcr, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. dpes occurring in the hippocampus of app/ps1 mice after cerebral ischemia were analyzed via label-free proteomics. the present study demonstrated that cerebral ischemia exacerbates learning and memory deficits in app/ps1 mice. cerebral ischemia aggravated the cognitive impairment in app/ps1 mice by worsening neuronal and synaptic loss through damage to intracellular autophagy, increased oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. notably, cerebral ischemia interfered with mitochondrial and nuclear transport functions in app/ps1 transgenic mice, thereby aggravating cognitive deficits. cellular transport functions may be a target for preventing ad progression. in summary, autophagy is impaired in app/ps1 mice compared with wt mice, and oxidative stress and neuroinflammation caused by cerebral ischemia exacerbate autophagy-induced damage and are responsible for cognitive decline. label-free proteomics indicated that cerebral ischemia results in abnormal abcb8, sestd1, tpr, and rab8a protein expression in the hippocampus of app/ps1 transgenic mice and that an imbalance of mitochondrial transport and nuclear transport functions exacerbates cognitive deficits. improving autophagy and restoring organelle transport may be targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia.",international immunopharmacology,eng,2024,Nov,"Ning Zhenqiu, Zhong Xiaoqin, Wang Yu, Hu Dafeng, Tang Xialin, Deng Minzhen","state key laboratory of traditional chinese medicine syndrome/department of neurology, the second affiliated hospital of guangzhou university of chinese medicine, guangdong provincial hospital of chinese medicine, guangdong provincial academy of chinese medical sciences, guangzhou 510006, pr china;
